>> <h3> Resume </h3>

<p> This is a program that starts a software called "Clima Onde Você Quiser", which is feasible to consult the weather up to your choice and other information. This software was designed in Python adapted by me, and the original work is from João Futi Muanda and you're able to check all in this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MV2sPAJ94E&list=PLGFzROSPU9oUzZ-qhotadjMMX8pX85gOv&index=1 </p>

>> <h3> Improvements </h3>

Compared with the original work these are the improvements in my version:

- All Information is in Portuguese
- Temperature in Celsius
- Feels like temperature
- Temperature > Minimiun and Maximum


>> <h3> How Works </h3>

<p> After coding it, you must be able to consult the city of your preference as well all other information provided by the API </p>

>> <h3> How To Start It </h3>

<p> Open up the code and paste it at the code editor of your preference. Recommedation: VSCode 4 </p>
